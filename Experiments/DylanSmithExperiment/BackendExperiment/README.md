<h1>Experiment 1</h1>
I created this experiment following a tutorial on youtube.
It creates a database context, and creates a new user every time a user
goes to a different id in browser.

<h1>How to use</h1>
Run the application. Go to browser and enter
"localhost:8080/svc/v1/contracts/[id]". Everytime you enter a new ID, it will create a new endpoint, and it will display the ID and my name on it.
